# OpenAI Agent SDK Issue Analysis

## Important Configuration Note

```python
from agents import set_default_openai_api
set_default_openai_api("chat_completions")  # This configuration is mandatory
```

- Does not work with the default `respond` endpoint
- Must explicitly set to `chat_completions` endpoint for proper functionality

## Identified Key Issues

### 1. aiohttp Session Management Issue
- **Problem**: aiohttp sessions are not properly cleaned up when using Litellm
- **Symptoms**: `Unclosed client session` and `Unclosed connector` warning messages
- **Temporary Workaround**:
  ```python
  import os
  os.environ["DISABLE_AIOHTTP_TRANSPORT"] = "True"
  ```
- **Impact**: Potential resource leaks during long-running operations

### 2. Tool Call ID Length Limitation
- **Problem**: Tool Call ID exceeds the 40-character limit, causing API errors
- **Error Message**:
  ```
  openai.BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {
    'error': {
      'message': "Invalid 'messages[2].tool_calls[0].id': string too long. 
      Expected a string with maximum length 40, but got a string with length 41",
      'type': 'invalid_request_error',
      'param': 'messages[2].tool_calls[0].id',
      'code': 'string_above_max_length'
    }
  }
  ```
- **Cause**: `'call_' + uuid.uuid4()` format (41 characters) exceeds OpenAI API's 40-character limit
- **Impact**: Inability to use tool functionality, compatibility issues between backends

## Concerns When Adopting OpenAI Agent SDK

1. **Compatibility Issues**
   - Compatibility problems with backend integration through Litellm proxy due to ID generation method
   - Potential additional issues when integrating with other models (Gemini, Azure, etc.)

2. **Unstable Session Management**
   - Potential resource leaks due to aiohttp session management issues
   - Concerns about stability degradation in long-running operations

3. **Limited Flexibility**
   - Hardcoded ID generation method makes customization difficult
   - Potential unexpected issues due to insufficient testing across various environments

## Conclusion

The current OpenAI Agent SDK has fundamental issues that may limit its use in production environments. In particular:
- Compatibility issues with various backend services
- Resource management concerns
- Limited flexibility

These issues necessitate careful consideration. Until these problems are resolved, testing in a limited environment is recommended.
